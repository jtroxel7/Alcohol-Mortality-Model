    "Our group decided to study the deaths related to alcohol use disorders since we noticed an unhealthy relationship within our society. In the United States, the legal drinking age is 21; however, this law is broken by a large proportion of people. As a result, the youth is not taught how to drink responsibly from an early age, and we believe this partly contributes to this unhealthy relationship. This observation is what initially attracted our group to look into alcohol datasets. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once we began examining different datasets, we started to think about the best data to look at to make a prediction model. After mining through many different datasets and considering the various implications, we examined the factors influencing alcohol-related mortality. We chose this dataset because it had sufficient predictors we could use to generate a compelling model."

    "Through limited research, we discovered that alcohol is responsible for 3 million deaths annually (5.3% of all deaths worldwide), according to the World Health Organization (WHO). We wanted to investigate this data more as we believe understanding the trends of alcohol-related deaths across different countries can help identify risk factors and inform policies. Through this project, we wanted to uncover which habits/indicators contribute to mass unhealthy drinking.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of this problem, we created a logistic model to classify a country as either high risk or not high risk. We defined this parameter as countries with attributable mortality rates greater than 6%. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, our problem was mostly an inference problem. It is in part a prediction problem because at the end of our project, we wanted to be able to predict if the country is high risk given the predictors and nothing else. However, it is more inference because our goal is not to predict a country's class but primarily to understand the relationship between the predictors and the response to understand which factors are leading to this high death rate.

    "The model has three main stakeholders, educators, health services, and governments, each with a crucial role in reducing the negative effects of alcohol misuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "Educators are one of the primary stakeholders in this project. By analyzing which factors contribute to a country being classified as high-risk, schools can effectively educate the youth on how to have healthy drinking habits. For example, they can focus on promoting responsible drinking behavior and provide information on the health consequences of alcohol misuse. Additionally, they can work on creating prevention programs that target high-risk individuals or groups. \n",

    "The second stakeholder, health services, plays a critical role in reducing the death rate related to alcohol misuse. This will enable them to identify high-risk individuals before they die, based on their demographic and other information available in our predictors. For example, doctors can use this information to identify patients who may be at risk for alcohol-related illnesses or who may require additional support to avoid harmful drinking behaviors. \n",

    "Governments are the third stakeholder in our project. By using our statistical analysis, they can more effectively target their laws and policies to foster a society with healthy drinking habits. For example, they may want to implement stricter regulations on when and how much an individual can buy alcohol."

    "- The predictor `daly_alc_use_disorders__all_ages_standardized` can help health services and governments as its significance in the final model teaches how impactful alcohol use disorders can be to a country's mortality rate. Health services can use this information to try to get more adept at spotting and treating alcohol use disorders, and governments can use it to provide funding for such endeavors by health services or by providing more programs to help people with alcohol use disorders. \n",

Educators can use this information to present the true harms ot heavy drinking to their country's youth, and health services and governments can use this information in a similar way that they would for the previous predictor.\n",
    "- The predictor `spirits_as_share_alcohol_consumption` can also help all stakeholders. Educators can inform the youth on the potential dangers of frequently using spirits, health services can try to focus on developing methods that better treat spirits, and governments may want to limit the production/distribution/consumption of spirits.\n",
    "- The predictor `total_alcohol_consumption_per_capita_liters` can primarily help governments. They can monitor this predictor to gauge whether their contry may be getting close to an dangerous amount of alcohol consumption, and then take precautions accordingly.\n",
